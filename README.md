Master OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) to Create Specifications for Your APIs

OpenAPI 3.0 is the leading tool for the documentation of APIs.

Formerly known as Swagger, OpenAPI has a long and established history. In 2010, Swagger started as an open source specification for designing and documenting RESTful APIs.

In 2015, the Swagger project was acquired by SmartBear Software. The Swagger Specification was donated to the Linux foundation and renamed the OpenAPI.

The OpenAPI specification is the cornerstone of a thriving open source community. Simply perform a search for OpenAPI tools and you will find projects for converters, documentation, validators, editors, mock servers, testing tools and much much more!

From the OpenAPI specification, you can generate client side source code for over 50 languages. You can generate server side code for over 40 different languages.

All of these open source contributes start with the OpenAPI specification, which we explore in depth in this course.

You start off the course with learning about what is an API, a review of the HTTP protocol and how it is used in respect to RESTFul APIs.

Then we start looking at OpenAPI and how it applies to documenting RESTFul APIs.

We then start writing an OpenAPI specification using Swagger Hub.

Swagger Hub is a free, easy to use on-line editor for Swagger and OpenAPI specifications.

You will get to create a complete OpenAPI specification for a RESTful web service.

Step by step, you learn how to:

    Edit a OpenAPI specification in Swagger Hub
    Define a OpenAPI specification in YAML
    Add developer information
    Add server information
    Define an API path
    Define an API operation
    Create robust objects with JSON schema constraints
    Improve the quality of your specification with re-useable components.
    Define query parameters
    Define path parameters
    Define GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations
    Create API security schemes
    Generate source code with OpenAPI Code Gen
    Use ReDoc to generate robust API documentation
    Use Apache Maven to generate code with OpenAPI Code Gen

This course has numerous assignments and hands on examples to get you comfortable writing OpenAPI specifications.

What youâ€™ll learn
